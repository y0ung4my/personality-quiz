This is a webpage made to help programmers decide what programming language to learn. The quiz uses a form of radio buttons, which once submitted, will reveal the result of what kind of programming language to learn. First edition of this website includes three choices: C#, Python, and Ruby. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* jQuery

## Description

Each question is in its own CSS-styled box. The question boxes are hidden when the form is submitted and the result is shown, along with a "start over" button. Once the "start over" button is clicked, the results and "start over" button are hidden again while the results and submit button are shown once again.
